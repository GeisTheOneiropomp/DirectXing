DirectXing: A DirectX 12 Demo
====================================================================================================

## Digest

This project implements several computer graphics effects. These include:

  -Lighting - (Spot, Point, and Directional Lighting)
  -Simple Texturing
  -Cube Mapping (Skybox)
  -Normal Mapping
  -Screen Space ambient occlusion
  -Shadow Mapping
  -Irradiance Environment Mapping (work in progress)

Because this is a DirectX12 demo, it takes advantage of resource aliasing and transitions.  

## Usage

	- The movement controls are a basic WASD layout (w is up, s is down, a is left, and r is right.)
	- The mouse is used to change angles.
	- Press F1 to toggle shadow mapping.
	- Press F2 to toggle screen space ambient occlusion on and off.
